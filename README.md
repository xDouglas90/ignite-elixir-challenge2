# ListFilter

**TODO:**
In this challenge, a new project must be created with a function that, given a list of strings that represent numbers or not (example ["1", "3", "6", "43", "banana", "6" , "abc"]), filter all numeric elements in the list and return how many odd numbers there are in that list.


## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `list_filter` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:list_filter, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/list_filter>.
